# jz-class-archive

This small scraping script tries to get a list of all course sections taught by a specific professor over the years, using a simple course search on Jenzabar.

------------------------------
### TODOs
- [ ] Resolve faculty selection error on search relaunch
- [ ] Investigate why class sections are not found
- [ ] Succeed in storing all class sections
- [ ] Write to file
- [ ] Configure constants: Faculty name, output file path, etc.
- [ ] Find a way to get browser driver based on desired browser and version (can I curl?)
