# jz-class-archive

This small scraping script tries to get a list of all course sections taught by a specific professor over the years, using a simple course search on Jenzabar.

------------------------------
### TODOs
- [x] Resolve faculty selection error on search relaunch
- [x] Investigate why class sections are not found
- [x] Succeed in storing all class sections
- [x] Write to file
- [ ] Investigate why so many sections are not found.
- [ ] Configure constants: Faculty name, output file path, semester interval, etc.
- [ ] Find a way to get browser driver based on desired browser and version (can I curl or wget?)
- [ ] Refactoring: use more named constants + clean up code + nicer comments
- [ ] Style: What's wrong with indentation on GitHub?
